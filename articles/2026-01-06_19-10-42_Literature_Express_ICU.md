### 第一部分 原文与翻译

**英文原标题：** Stability and compatible of levofloxacin, clindamycin phosphate and fluconazole in various peritoneal solution.

> **英文摘要：**
> INTRODUCTION: Some antibiotics are recommended by ISPD for peritonitis treatment but does not have stability and compatibility data in different conditions yet. The current study was to investigate the stability and compatibility of such drugs.
> 
> METHODS: Levofloxacin, clindamycin phosphate and fluconazole were tested in the study. Three different commercially available peritoneal dialysis solutions were selected. Two were glucose-based (2.5%, Ca 1.25mmol/L, lactate buffered) solution, one with PVC package and the other with non-PVC package. The third solution was icodextrin (non-PVC package). The stability of the three antibiotics were tested in the three different dialysates in different temperature (4 ℃ and 25℃) for 6 hours, 1 days, 2 days and 7 days. For 37℃, the storage stability was tested only for 6 hours. The test antibiotics concentrations were selected as ISPD recommended or based on published data. All conditions were repeated separately in three bags. The antibiotics concentrations were measured by Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
> 
> RESULTS: For clindamycin phosphate and fluconazole, there was no significant change in final concentration over the 7 days study period for both 4 ℃ and 25℃. For 37 ℃, there was also no difference in concentration for clindamycin phosphate and fluconazole. For levofloxacin, there was no significant change in concentration over 7 days for 4 ℃. The concentration of levofloxacin was slightly higher after store in 25℃ and 37℃, while the exact differences were less than 3%. Drug concentrations were generally lower in icodextrin than in glucose-based solutions. The exact differences were less than 10%. The difference between icodextrin and glucose-based solutions was higher than the two glucose-based solutions with different container material (PVC vs non-PVC).
> 
> CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin, clindamycin phosphate and fluconazole were stable and compatible with both glucose-based and icodextrin solutions. They might be stored for up to 7 days at room temperature (25℃). It is not suggested to store the dialysate for long time once warmed up to body temperature.

> **中文摘要：**
> 引言：部分抗生素被国际腹膜透析学会（ISPD）推荐用于腹膜炎的治疗，但目前尚无在不同条件下关于其稳定性和相容性的数据。本研究旨在探讨此类药物的稳定性和相容性。
> 
> 方法：本研究测试了左氧氟沙星、磷酸克林霉素和氟康唑。选择了三种市售腹膜透析液，其中两种为葡萄糖基（2.5%，钙 1.25 mmol/L，乳酸盐缓冲）的透析液，一种为 PVC 包装，另一种为非 PVC 包装；第三种为艾考糊精（非 PVC 包装）溶液。分别在三种透析液中，于 4 ℃ 和 25 ℃ 下储存 6 小时、1 天、2 天和 7 天测试药物稳定性；在 37 ℃ 下，仅测试储存 6 小时的稳定性。抗生素浓度按 ISPD 推荐或文献数据设定。每一条件均独立重复三袋。药物浓度采用液相色谱-串联质谱（LC-MS/MS）测定。
> 
> 结果：磷酸克林霉素和氟康唑在 4 ℃ 与 25 ℃ 下 7 天内浓度变化无显著性差异；在 37 ℃ 下，其浓度亦未出现明显变化。左氧氟沙星在 4 ℃ 下 7 天内浓度稳定，而在 25 ℃ 和 37 ℃ 下浓度略有升高，但差异小于 3%。在艾考糊精溶液中的药物浓度总体低于葡萄糖基透析液，差异小于 10%。艾考糊精与葡萄糖基溶液之间的差异大于两种不同容器材料（PVC 与非 PVC）之间的差异。
> 
> 结论：左氧氟沙星、磷酸克林霉素和氟康唑在葡萄糖基和艾考糊精透析液中均具有良好的稳定性和相容性。在室温（25 ℃）下可储存长达 7 天，但不建议在加温至体温后长时间储存透析液。

### 第二部分 AI 大师评价

本研究针对腹膜透析感染常用抗生素的稳定性与相容性开展系统验证，弥补了部分药物在不同透析液体系中缺乏质量数据的空白。作者采用 LC-MS/MS 精确测定三种药物在不同温度与包装条件下的浓度变化，结果表明它们在葡萄糖基与艾考糊精溶液中均稳定 7 天。该研究为临床药液配制与储存提供了实验依据，具有较强应用价值。局限在于仅考察了少数药物及短期时间范围，需进一步验证临床相关性与长期稳定性。
